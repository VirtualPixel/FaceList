# FaceList
FaceList is an application showing knowledge of CoreData, CoreImage, Mapkit (To come), and the MVVM design pattern.

Meet FaceList. Add new "Faces" so that you'll never forget the name or face of the person you just met again. Simply press the "Plus" button on the navigation bar, select a photo, choose a name, and save. The main screen of the application shows the list of saved names.

Since it's not efficient to save images to CoreData, I converted the image to a UIKit image/JpegData and saved to the documents directory under a randomly generated UUID as the name in the documents directory.
